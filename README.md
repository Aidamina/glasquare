Glasquare
=========
**Unofficial FourSquare glassware**

This project is in a very early stage - I started it at hackathon in Prague using Mirror API, but now I'm rewriting it using GDK.

What it can do
--------------
- adds voice command 'Nearby venues'
- then it displayes nearest venue according to Foursquare recommendation engine

Plans
-----
Big :)

How to build it
---------------
Import it into Android Studio via Gradle.
